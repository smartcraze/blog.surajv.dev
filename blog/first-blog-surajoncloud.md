### Well, everybody would be wondering who am I?

I am Suraj Vishwakarma from Bangalore, currently doing B.Tech in Computer Science from Lovely Professional University. I have always been interested in playing with computers.

I got my first PC when I was in 6th standard. I asked my father when I was in 3rd, btw. Although my father gave me a laptop, no one had imagined that it was the first computer of my whole family, and maybe no one knew how to use it or had even seen a laptop before.  

I learned Paint when I was in school. They took the whole class to the computer lab, and the very first time I remembered is that they asked us to type our names. I was unable to find the letters where they existed.

## From Town to Big City

My family moved from Garhwa to Bangalore, and their whole life changed.
