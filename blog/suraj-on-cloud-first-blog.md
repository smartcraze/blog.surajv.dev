## **Well, everybody might be wondering who I am ?**

I am Suraj Vishwakarma from Bangalore, currently pursuing a [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in Computer Science from Lovely Professional University. I have always been interested in playing with computers.

I got my first PC when I was in 6th grade. I had asked my father for one when I was in 3rd grade, but he eventually gave me a laptop. No one in my family had imagined that it would be the first computer for our entire family, and perhaps no one knew how to use it or had even seen a laptop before.

I learned to use Paint when I was in school. They took the whole class to the computer lab, and the very first task I remember was being asked to type our names. I was unable to find where the letters were located on the keyboard.

## From Town to Big City

My family moved from Garhwa to Bangalore, and our whole life changed.
